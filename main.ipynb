      "\n",
      "Under certain well-defined conditions, a population of yeast cells exhibits glycolytic oscillations that synchronize through intercellular acetaldehyde. This implies that the dynamic phenomenon of the oscillation propagates within and between cells. We here develop a method to establish by which route dynamics propagate through a biological reaction network. Application of the method to yeast demonstrates how the oscillations and the synchronization signal can be transduced. That transduction is not so much through the backbone of glycolysis, as via the Gibbs energy and redox coenzyme couples (ATP/ADP, and NADH/NAD), and via both intra- and intercellular acetaldehyde.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Under some conditions, the concentrations of metabolites of the glycolytic pathway oscillate (Duysens and Amesz, 1957, Betz and Chance, 1965 and Hess and Boiteux, 1980). In suspensions of intact yeast cells that have been harvested during the growth-phase transition between using glucose and ethanol as the substrate, then starved and subsequently presented with glucose and cyanide, these oscillations are sustained (Richard et al., 1993 and Richard et al., 1996a). The reproducible observation of limit-cycle oscillations in well-defined, intact cells, has made it possible to study intracellular dynamics and its control under stationary conditions (Hess and Boiteux, 1980, Termonia and Ross, 1981, Richard et al., 1996a, Richard et al., 1996b and Reijenga et al., 1998).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the oscillations to be observable, they had to be synchronous in the billions of cells in the cuvette. Indeed, mixing of cell populations that oscillated 180\u00b0 out of phase, only caused a transient disappearance of the oscillations (Richard et al., 1996b), evidencing some sort of active synchronization. Acetaldehyde synchronizes the oscillations between the cells (Richard et al., 1994 and Richard et al., 1996b). This identification has made this system also an attractive model for the study of the control of intercellular dynamics (Wolf and Heinrich, 2000 and Bier et al., 2000).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the mechanism of these oscillations, a number of proposals exist. Some focus on phosphofructokinase as the pacemaker, others on the stoichiometry of the reaction network (Sel\u2019kov, 1975 and Goldbeter, 1996). The notion that control of the oscillations would have to be confined to phosphofructokinase has been shown to be unjustified for either type of model (Teusink et al., 1996 and Bier et al., 1996). Preliminary results suggest that control of the frequency of the oscillations is distributed over a number of molecular processes, one of which includes glucose transport (Reijenga et al., 1998; cf., Markus et al., 1984).\n",
      "\n",
      "A crucial issue in how a dynamic cellular system controls itself is the active networking in which its macromolecules engage. Upon a perturbation anywhere in the system, the enzymes around that perturbation respond in terms of a change in rate. The changes in rates result in secondary perturbations, which again result in rate changes of surrounding enzymes. The key property of stable systems is that the resulting parallel chains of changes precisely return the system to its original state (Westerhoff and Van Dam, 1987). To understand the internal regulation of cellular systems, it is important to understand how the various changes match precisely (Kahn and Westerhoff, 1993). In systems at steady state, such an analysis is difficult. Because cause and effect cannot be distinguished temporally; one should analyze transient perturbations, or cut up regulatory links in the system (Snoep et al., 1999). For systems engaged in limit cycles, it is more feasible to trace the paths of the system dynamics, because these allow the analysis of phase (Betz and Chance, 1965) and amplitude (Richard et al., 1996a) differences. Because of the possibility to measure reliably and rapidly the glycolytic intermediates during the oscillations (Richard et al., 1996a), we set out to determine the chain of events in synchronizing yeast glycolytic oscillations. Such a study should not only address the chain of events within individual cells, but also that between the cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly in this respect, Richard et al. (1996a) found oscillations in glycolytic metabolites to be virtually confined to the hexose phosphates in the upper part of the glycolytic pathway. Oscillations were observed in the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F16P). The concentrations of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate oscillated at a relative amplitude of less than 2% for DHAP and less than 30% for the other metabolites. The concentrations of 1,3-biphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG) and 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) were below the detection limit. These findings suggested that neither the oscillations in intercellular acetaldehyde concentration, nor the cell\u2013cell synchronization could be understood in terms of a cause\u2013effect chain running through the intermediates of the glycolytic pathway itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "To rationalize this, Richard et al. (1996a) pointed out that the coenzymes engaged in glycolysis, i.e., ATP(ADP) and NAD(H), also oscillated in terms of their concentrations. Following this lead, we here elaborate a mechanism for the propagation of the oscillations and their phase through the glycolytic network in and between the individual cells. By suppressing other possible modes of transfer of dynamics, we show that this mechanism may indeed be responsible for the experimental observations in dynamically coupled oscillating yeast cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The models\n",
      "\n",
      "We have set up a minimum model of glycolysis in yeast that suffices to describe the essence of the experimental observations of Richard et al., 1996a and Richard et al., 1996b. This model contains lumped reactions of the glycolytic pathway and includes production of glycerol, fermentation to ethanol and exchange of acetaldehyde between the cells, and trapping of acetaldehyde by cyanide. The system was analyzed with the software packages AUTO (Doedel, 1981) as well as a Runge-Kutta\u2013Merson integration routine. In the situation under study, respiration is absent, and ethanol is the main end product of glycolysis. The reactions and fluxes under consideration are shown in Fig. 1. For the extracellular fluxes, we take into account a glucose flux into the cell. Ethanol and glycerol concentrations are considered fixed due to the large extracellular reservoir with which they are supposed to equilibrate. Minor side fluxes are fluxes resulting from the exchange of acetaldehyde between the cell and the surrounding medium, a glycerol production flux, and an extracellular sink for acetaldehyde. The cell membrane is treated as impermeable for metabolites other than glucose, acetaldehyde, and ethanol.\n",

      "The intracellular reactions that are taken into consideration are: ALD, aldolase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; PDC, pyruvate decarboxylase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase. The model includes the degradation of the coupling substance in the external solution (CYA), i.e., the reaction of acetaldehyde with cyanide. Consumption of ATP is taken into account by including an ATPase. Some reactions describe lumped processes. This concerns the reactions catalyzed by hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) (lumped in reaction HK\u2013PFK), the glycerol-producing steps (resulting in reaction GLY) as well as phosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase (lumped together in reaction PK).\n",

The equilibrium constants for GAPDH and PGK lead to a very small steady-state concentration of 3PG and, hence, to a short average life time as compared to the other metabolites. This warrants a quasi-steady-state approximation for [1,3BPG] (see Heinrich and Schuster, 1996). From d[1,3BPG]/dt = 0, it follows that vGAPDH = vPGK, and, for the concentration of 1,3BPG\n",

      "\n",
      "We first examined whether the 9-variable system (Eqs. (7a), (7b), (7c), (7d), (7e), (7f), (7g), (7h), (7i), (8a), (8b), (8c), (8d), (8e), (8f), (8g), (8h), (8i), (8j), (9a), (9b), (9c), (9d), (9e), (9f), (10a), (10b), (10c), (8a), (8b), (8c), (8d), (8e), (8f), (8g), (8h), (8i), (8j), (9a), (9b), (9c), (9d), (9e), (9f), (10a), (10b) and (10c)) could describe the dynamics we observed experimentally (Richard et al., 1996a and Richard et al., 1996b). The reference parameter set shown in Table 1 was chosen, such that the steady-state concentrations and fluxes were in an experimentally realistic range. In the following, we use the degradation rate constant of acetaldehyde (k9) as the bifurcation parameter. Experimentally, k9 can be modulated by changing the cyanide concentration. For each value of k9, the system had one steady state with nonnegative metabolite concentrations. This steady state was stable if the degradation rate k9 was small and unstable for higher values of this parameter (see Fig. 3). The instable steady state arose via a subcritical (http://mrb.niddk.nih.gov/glossary/glossary.html) Hopf bifurcation in the point, indicated by k9(H) in Fig. 3. In the region k9(S) \u2264 k9 \u2264 k9(H), a stable steady state and an unstable limit cycle coexisted. k9(S) denotes a saddle-node bifurcation of the limit cycle, with the consequence that, for k9(S) \u2264 k9 \u2264 k9(H), a stable steady state and an instable limit cycle coexisted with a stable limit cycle. In Fig. 3, the steady-state concentration and the minima and maxima of the oscillations are drawn for the variable N2.\n",
